* Regenerate expired self-signed certificate on a UCS system
* Clear SEL Logs of a UCS IMC / of all discovered servers on a UCS system
* Clear all user sessions of a UCS IMC / UCS system / UCS central
* Reset Device Connector of a UCS IMC / UCS system


## Device actions

### Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The file **[easyucs.py](../easyucs.py)** is the main file that you will use. 
You can have find help at each step by entering the **"-h"** argument.

It first needs the type of scope of action you want to use as an argument. 
The scope of action:
```
Scope:

  {config,inventory,schemas,report,device}
                        EasyUCS scope
    config              config-related actions
    inventory           inventory-related actions
    schemas             schemas-related actions
    report              report-related actions
    device              device-related actions
```

The second argument is the type of action:
```
Action:
  {regenerate_certificate,clear_sel_logs,clear_user_sessions,reset_device_connector}
                        Device actions
